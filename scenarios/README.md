# Scenarios

This directory contains **problem-driven scenarios** designed to simulate real-world engineering situations.

Scenarios are not projects and not proofs.  
They are **thinking exercises with concrete constraints**.

A scenario answers:
> “If this were a real problem, how would I approach it?”

## What belongs here?
- Well-defined problem statements
- Clear assumptions and constraints
- Expected outputs or evaluation criteria
- Reasoning paths, not full implementations

## What does NOT belong here?
- Full production code
- Finished end-to-end systems (those belong in `projects/`)
- Learning notes (those belong in `docs/`)

## Structure
Scenarios are grouped by difficulty:
- `beginner/`
- `intermediate/`
- `advanced/`

Each scenario folder has its own `README.md`.

## Related outputs
- `docs/concepts/` (theory used)
- `proofs/` (if a scenario evolves into a proof)
- `projects/` (if a scenario becomes a full system)

## Türkçe

Bu klasör, **gerçek dünya problemlerini simüle eden senaryoları** içerir.

Scenario:
- proje değildir,
- kanıt değildir,
- **düşünme egzersizidir**.

Amaç:
“Bu gerçek bir problem olsaydı nasıl yaklaşırdım?” sorusunu cevaplamaktır.
