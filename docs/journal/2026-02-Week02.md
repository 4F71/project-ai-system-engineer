### ML System Proof – Repeat Purchase Prediction

Completed and documented an end-to-end ML system focused on repeat purchase prediction.
Key focus areas included EDA-driven feature design, user-based validation, and business-aligned metric selection.

## Mathematical Foundations — Linear Algebra (Norms) & Square Root Fluency

This week focused on strengthening numerical fluency and foundational linear algebra concepts.

### Concepts Added
- Numerical Foundations — Square Root Computation
- Linear Algebra — Norms (L1 vs L2)

### Evidence

- proofs/02-math/assets/l1-vs-l2-path.png


### What Was Verified

- Exact and decimal square root computations
- Fraction-based root derivations
- L1 and L2 norm calculations in 2D and 3D
- L1 ≥ L2 relationship
- Unit vector condition (||v||₂ = 1)

### Insight

Square root computation and norm behavior directly support:
- Euclidean distance
- Cosine similarity
- Vector normalization

This reinforces the mathematical foundation required for ML system engineering.
