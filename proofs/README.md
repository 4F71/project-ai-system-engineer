# Proofs

This directory contains **verifiable evidence** of technical competence.

Proofs are not explanations or tutorials.  
They are **claims backed by artifacts**.

A proof answers the question:
> “How do we know you can actually do this?”

## What belongs here?
- Demonstrations of applied knowledge
- Small but concrete technical artifacts
- Evaluated outputs
- Focused implementations tied to specific skills

## What does NOT belong here?
- End-to-end projects (those belong in `projects/`)
- Learning notes (those belong in `docs/`)
- Experiments without conclusions

## Structure
Each subfolder represents a **domain of competence**.
Each proof file must:
- have a clear scope
- reference inputs and outputs
- link to related projects or docs

## Related
- `projects/` (systems that use these proofs)
- `docs/concepts/` (theory behind the proofs)

Bu klasör, **teknik yetkinliğin kanıtlarını** içerir.

Proof:
- anlatmaz,
- öğretmez,
- **kanıtlar**.

Her proof, “bunu gerçekten yapabiliyor musun?” sorusuna cevap verir.
