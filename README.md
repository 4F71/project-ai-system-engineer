# AI System Engineer Roadmap — Proof-Based Journey

This repository documents a **proof-driven journey** toward becoming a  
**Production-grade AI System Engineer**.

It is not a tutorial repository.  
It is not a collection of random notes.

This is a **structured system** designed to show:
- how learning is planned,
- how progress is validated,
- and how skills are proven with evidence.

## How to Read This Repository

If you are an HR, senior engineer, or reviewer:

1. **Start with the roadmap**
   - `roadmap/MASTER-ROADMAP.md`
   - This defines *what* is being learned and *why*.

2. **Check progress**
   - `progress-tracker.md`
   - Only completed items with evidence are checked.

3. **Review proofs**
   - `proofs/`
   - Each completed topic is backed by code, logs, or commits.

4. **Look at applied work**
   - `projects/`
   - End-to-end systems and capstone implementations.

5. **See learning discipline**
   - `docs/journal/` and `docs/retrospectives/`
   - Shows consistency, reflection, and iteration.

## Design Principles

- No unchecked claims
- No progress without evidence
- No unnecessary complexity
- Clear separation of public and private thinking

---

## What This Repo Is *Not*

- A finished product
- A blog
- A showcase of buzzwords

It is a **living system**, evolving through disciplined execution.

---

## Status

Early stage by design.  
Structure first, then depth.

Progress is intentional, not rushed.
